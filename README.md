In this project, I build a shooter game using JavaScript's framework [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/), a "fast, free and fun open-source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games".

## About

This project's objective is to build a shooter game similar to [York Computer's](https://learn.yorkcs.com/category/tutorials/gamedev/phaser-3/build-a-space-shooter-with-phaser-3/) tutorial. So I used the main idea to create shooter game.

## Game

This is a simple endless runner. Enemies appear at the top of the canvas Some shoot you, some pass straight, some pursue you. You control your ship with keyboard **arrows** while you shoot with **space**. Just destroy as many enemies as you can before you die.

In the end, you can add your name to our **Leaders Board** and check the high scores.**Leaders Board** only show the top  scores if you beat all scores then your score will be among the top of the other scores.

## How to play

To control your ship you should use these **arrows**.These are UPS, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT keyboards. To shoot enemies using  **space** .

You can play the game online by clicking [here](https://lucid-murdock-16348a.netlify.app/) or locally following these steps:
